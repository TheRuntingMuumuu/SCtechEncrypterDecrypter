# Known issues
Do not complain to us about these issues, we are working on fixing them !

- some characters, e.g. \`!', do not decrypt properly
- in the GUI edition, when you do a second encryption/decryption, it still shows first one, and this gets confusing  
(I know how to fix this -- just put the text in a new window --  but I am too lazy to do it right now)
