Sugarcane Tech encrypter and decrypter program

# What is it?
The SCtech encryptor software is software that encrypts text. We are constantly making it better, and we hope you enjoy it.

# Can it encrypt files?
No, not yet, and currently it may have a few bugs that we must fix.

# Running the script
To run the script, type in your command prompt `python3 runthis.py`. You could just type in `python3 Encrypter.py` but there would be very unfriendly errors instead of easy-to-read errors.  

# Future projections
See the [Projects](https://github.com/Theruntingmuumuu/SCtechEncrypterDecrypter/Projects) tab.
